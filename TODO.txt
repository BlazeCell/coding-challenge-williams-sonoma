DONE:

- Added HTML DOCTYPE.
- Reconfigured code to not assign anything to 'window' and 'document'.
- View modules only have access to the data that they need.
- Model-View-Controller structure much more clearly embraced.
- Modules are now structured to have narrower responsibilities.
- Modals are now designed to be created when they're needed and destroyed when they're not.
- Adjusted styling so that images aren't shrunken when hovered.
