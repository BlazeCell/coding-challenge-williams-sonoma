# Coding Challenge for Williams Sonoma

This project is a demonstration of my skills with Javascript (EcmaScript 6.0), Responsive Experience, and UI/UX Design.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Version Control: [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Server: [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installing

Download this project to your computer by either clicking 'Download ZIP' above then extracting the archive to your prefered folder.

Or clone it if you have git installed:
```
git clone https://github.com/BlazeCell/coding-challenge-williams-sonoma
```

## Run the Site Locally

With node.js installed, open your command line navigate to the project folder:

```
cd path/to/project/directory
```

Once the command line is looking at that directory, run the node server:

```
node server
```

If the server is running successfully, you should see the following output:

```
Server live
Listening on port 80
```

Once the server is up and running, open your browser of choice and navigate to:

**[localhost](http://localhost)**

The site should load and you can play with the UI.

## Running the tests

### Unit Tests

This project is tested with custom unit tests.

To run the tests, make sure the server is running and navigate your browser to:

**[localhost/test](http://localhost/test)**

The test output is displayed in the browser console.

To access the browser console, press **F12** (in Chrome) or right-click the page and select the '**Inspect Element**'.

Then focus the '**Console**' tab and you should see the test results in the log.

### Linter

This project is linted with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

To run the linter, open the command line and navigate to the project folder:

```
cd path/to/project/directory
```

Once the command line is looking at that directory, run the ESLint:

#### Windows:

```
node_modules\.bin\eslint public
```

#### Mac/Linux:

```
node_modules/.bin/eslint public
```

As the there are currently no errors, no output should appear.
